The missing editor to gh pages.

# Introduction

gh pages + Jekyll is the perfect combo to host a static website, but users need to have some skills in order to create content (by content, I mean simple pages with text & images):
* Markdown syntax. Ok, it's not that difficult but you know sometimes wysiwyg editors can be effective.
* Images handling (upload and management) are not there.

This project aims to be a frontend to a gh pages repository. It should provide:
* Clean interface with a really simple list of pages
* Have a really simple wysiwyg editor, we don't need Wow (Word on the web)
* Support image uploading and handling
* (Provide a simple mechanism for menu generation)

# State
This is WIP

# Todos
* Authent with gh
* List repos, select only gh pages
* Inspect pages or posts and list them
* Find a simple js editor which translates content to md
* Support in place image uploading
* (Support browsing uploaded images)
* Have a look at https://www.aviary.com/
